This should be an example Android app, which is opened when an NFC tag was detected.
The code of this project is based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KyVihl6ACmQ but at least on my phone (HUAWEI P smart FIG-LX1) the app is not opened.

To verify that the app has NFC permissions at all, the app waits for an NFC tag and changes shown text, if an NFC tag was detected. This works.
